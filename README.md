## In this activity, we learned how to create a functioning todo calender where your listed item is saved under the specified hour.
The index.html linking stylesheets and https://code.jquery.com/jquery... for the scheduling website.

The timeblocks for the past/present/and future hours are color coded with grey, green or red, and is determined by the comparison between the local server vs the code number it aligns with. This is further displayed in the JavaScript page.

- continuation of the same time blocks from 9am-12am so there is enough space for the day.

- Important to add a click event with the buttons that are made. The querySelectorAll allows it to work on every button there is. 
- When the consol log is opened, you are able to see the hour the to do item is marked in and what the object is.

- adding specific requirements for each time block category of past/present/ and future. If the current hour is ___ then it would compare with the time in the website and determine the function for each event of the time. 
- allowing the local storage to take place so once the page is refreshed, the data that is inputed will not disapear, but get saved, as the icon suggests.

## Key Notes:
-using functions of if/else, and conditionals. 
-using a localSotrage function to save items once refreshed.
-using jquery to relate real-world events to the deployed webpage
-the conditionals along with the jquery allows it to update as the time changes.

## Challenge was accomplished through the help of these people.
- Professor Jared Kotoff for explaining local storage further.
- TA's with their explanations over applying jquery functions and deploying useful information on slack
- Tutor: Trinh Nguyen with helping me debug and fix issues that had come up during the process.
- Past assignements to help with the structure of how formulas are expressed.
